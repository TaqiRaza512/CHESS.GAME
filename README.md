# CHESS
The project involved creating a class hierarchy with classes such as Board, Pieces, Color, King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight,
and Pawn, using inheritance and polymorphism to ensure code reusability and maintainability.
The project implemented all the standard rules of chess, including stalemate, checkmate, self-check, castling, and pawn
promotion, ensuring the game is playable and challenging.
The project also featured an exceptional feature of replaying all the moves, allowing users to review and analyze their
games, which is a valuable tool for improving their chess skills.
